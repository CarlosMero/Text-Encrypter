# Text-Encrypter

This is a web page that encrypt and desencrypt text given by the user and it's pretty friendly.

It includes four buttons:

**Encrypt:** Encrypts the text entered and displays the encrypted text. <br>
**Decrypt:** Decrypts the text entered and displays the decrypted text. <br>
**Reset:** Clears the text entered. <br>
**Copy:** Copies the text displayed after encryption or decryption to the clipboard. <br>

The JavaScript code uses the addEventListener() method to attach click event listeners to the buttons. When the encrypt button is clicked, the input text is passed to the encrypt() function. The return value of the encrypt() function is then displayed. <br>
Similarly, when the decrypt button is clicked, the input text passed to the decrypt() function and the return value of the decrypt() function is then displayed.

**_The keys are as follows:_**

The letter "a" it turns into "ai" <br>
The letter "e" it turns into "enter" <br>
The letter "i" it turns into "imes" <br>
The letter "i" it turns into "imes" <br>
The letter "o" it turns into "ober" <br>
The letter "u" it turns into "ufat" <br>

Have fun with it!.
