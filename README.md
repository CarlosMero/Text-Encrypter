# Text-Encrypter

This is a web page that encrypt and desencrypt text given by the user and it's pretty friendly.

It includes four buttons:

**Encrypt:** This button encrypts the text entered in the text area and displays the encrypted text. <br>
**Decrypt:** This button decrypts the text entered in the text area and displays the decrypted text. <br>
**Reset:** This button clears the text entered in the text area. <br>
**Copy:** This button copies the text displayed after encryption or decryption to the clipboard. <br>

The JavaScript code uses the addEventListener() method to attach click event listeners to the buttons. When the encrypt button is clicked, the text in the text area is passed to the encrypt() function. The return value of the encrypt() function is then displayed. <br>
Similarly, when the decrypt button is clicked, the text in the text area is passed to the decrypt() function and the return value of the decrypt() function is then displayed.

**_The keys are as follows:_**

The letter "a" it turns into "ai" <br>
The letter "e" it turns into "enter" <br>
The letter "i" it turns into "imes" <br>
The letter "i" it turns into "imes" <br>
The letter "o" it turns into "ober" <br>
The letter "u" it turns into "ufat" <br>

Have fun with it!.
